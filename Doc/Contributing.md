# Contributing

If you decided to give away your works to the repository, then here are some useful information on how to do so:

## Your very own repo version

There is option to fork this repository (create personal version of it).
There, you can perform actions as if you were the owner of the repo.

## Files

Files should have .md extension so it can be stylized like this one.

If you are willing to create new species profile, there should be some templates available in this repository.

You can also take a look at already published files to take inspiration from them.

# Folders

The `Archives` folder is the "major" folder here. It contains subfolders which contain the 
.md files.

**It'd be cool if you replaced any space withing name with `_`**

Sublfolders directly parented to `Archives` should be named after planet. Subfolders of *planet* folder should be named as follows:

`Time` and the index of time.
If there is already folder `Time1`, then you may create `Time2`, etc.

And, finally, in time folder there are profiles of the species
