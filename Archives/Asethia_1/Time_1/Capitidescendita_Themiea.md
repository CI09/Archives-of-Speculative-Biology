**Genus**: Capitidescendita

**Average maturation age**: 10 months

**Preffered temperatures**: 5℃ - 25℃

**Activity**: Diurnal

### Reproduction
*Terrameliquare Themiea* reproduces sexually, with no mating seasons. 

Birth is given after 3-months long viviparity period. The mother organism then takes care of the young organism for approximately 10 months after which it abandons it continueing its preffered lifestyle once the younger reaches maturation.

### Appearance
*Terrameliquare Themiea* is brightly-colored (usually white, some appeared to have yellow-ish hue), two-legged organism reaching averagely 2 meters in height. It's head supports filter-feeding mouth capable of extracting microorganisms from ground, has one pair of entirely black eyes and, because of its spine shape, is always low enough to easily being consumption (*Capitidescendita*).

It has 4 fingers on each of its flat-surfaced feet which are placed on 3-joint legs of great musculature. Its lumbar section is relatively slim in comparison to the chest and both of them measure averagly 2 meters length together. The organism sustains 2 meters long tail which serves as counter-ballast for its head.

### Behaviour
*Terrameliquare Themiea* spends most of its day walking with its head low enough to contantly filter any nutrition sources from the ground. It tries to avoid any members of other species, but it hasn't been seen fleeing from them if they get too close. Although, when endangered it prefers to flee developing speed up to 45 km/h. 

It rests from evening to morning and thus is diurnal.
