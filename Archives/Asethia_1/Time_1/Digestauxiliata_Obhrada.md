**Kingdom**: Bacteria

**Phylum**: Bacillota

**Class**: Bacilli

**Order**: Plustomachupurgata

**Family**: Vastusuperstes

**Genus**: Digestauxiliata

## Biology
**Average lifespan**: 2 months

### Reproduction
*Digestauxiliata Obhrada* reproduces asexually, via mitosis. 

Occasionally, some individuals may be expelled alongside with the waste of the host, and entering a state of hybernation, waiting to be consumed by another potential host.

### Appearance
*Digestauxiliata Obhrada* is brightly-colored bacteria of rod shape, with diameter of averagely 2 µm and length of averagely 4 µm.

## Symbiotic Relationships
*Digestauxiliata Obhrada* Lives in intestines of [Capitidescentia Themiea](https://github.com/CI09/Archives-of-Speculative-Biology/blob/branch_1/Archives/Asethia_1/Time_1/Capitidescendita_Themiea.md) individuals in large colonies.
It feeds on nutrients from host's digestion and in exchange expells enzyme capable of dissolving polysaccharides which grants additional nutrients for both species.
